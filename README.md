# Pi Extensions

Custom extensions for [Pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent), a coding agent.

> [!WARNING]
> Feel free to use these, but they're mainly for my personal use and I might not read/merge your pr. Also, I haven't read a single line of code so I can't be held responsible if something bad happens. Godspeed ✌️

## Installation

Install all extensions from this repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/aliou/pi-extensions
```

To install selectively (or disable specific extensions), edit your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "git:github.com/aliou/pi-extensions",
      "extensions": [
        "extensions/processes/index.ts",
        "extensions/defaults/index.ts",
        "!extensions/the-dumb-zone/index.ts"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Some extensions are published individually to npm:

```bash
pi install npm:@aliou/pi-processes
```

## Themes

### [jellybeans](themes/jellybeans/)

Jellybeans mono theme variants.

## UX

Bidirectional Neovim integration. Injects visible splits into context, reloads files after edits, sends LSP diagnostics. Includes a Neovim plugin for the editor side.

### [processes](extensions/processes/)
