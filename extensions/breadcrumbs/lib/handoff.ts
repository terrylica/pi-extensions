Extract the FINAL STATE of what was accomplished and call create_handoff_context with the results.

Write relevantInformation in FIRST PERSON, as if you did the work and are briefing yourself for the next session. Use "I" statements:
- "I implemented X" not "X was implemented"
- "I decided to use Y because Z" not "Y was chosen"
- "I still need to do W" not "W needs to be done"

Focus on WHERE THINGS ENDED UP, not the journey:
- If something was planned then implemented, say "I implemented it"
- If something was discussed then decided against, state the final decision
- The new session needs the current state, not the full history

Cover:
- What I built / changed
- Final decisions and why
- Current technical details (APIs, data structures, patterns in use)
- What works and what is broken right now
- Remaining open questions or next steps

For relevantFiles, list file paths that are relevant to the goal.

Be concise and specific. Prioritize the END of the conversation over the beginning.
You MUST call create_handoff_context exactly once.`;
